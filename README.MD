# Advent of Code

My solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

From the website:

*Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.*
